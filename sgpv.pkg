d Second Generation P-Values are the proportion of null-hypotheses supported by the data.
d They are easier to understand than ordinary p-values.
d See the {help sgpv:help file} after installation for introduction.
d Additional dialog boxes further help with using the commands are available. 
d and can also be added to the User-menubar by running {stata sgpv menuInstall}.
